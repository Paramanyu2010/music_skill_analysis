The data for this project comes from a **simulated dataset designed to represent key aspects of music performance and learning**. While the source is not a public repository like SCORE, it was meticulously generated to provide realistic scenarios for exploring the dynamics between practice habits, lesson types, and musical outcomes. This dataset includes a comprehensive set of records, enabling analysis of various factors contributing to a musician's proficiency.

The original data was conceived to reflect typical progress and variations observed in music education, encompassing a range of skill levels and engagement patterns. It includes data points for individual musicians participating in different lesson contexts, providing a robust foundation for identifying trends in musical development.

Data cleaning involved several critical steps to ensure the integrity and analytical readiness of the dataset. Column names were standardized to improve readability and consistency. Crucially, categorical variables such as `Class_Level` (now `learning_level`), `Lesson_Type` (now `lesson_context`), `Instrument`, and `Gender` were explicitly converted to factor types to facilitate proper statistical analysis and visualization. Furthermore, any entries where `Performance_Score` exceeded 100% were identified as erroneous and subsequently filtered out, preventing misrepresentation in the analysis. No other observations were removed based on performance criteria; the goal was to maintain a complete representation of the generated data.

The dataset includes the following key variables:

* **`practice_duration_min`**: Focus time dedicated to practice (in minutes). This serves as a proxy for engagement.
* **`performance_score`**: Overall musical performance score (0-100%).
* **`learning_level`**: Categorical indicator of the musician's proficiency (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
* **`lesson_context`**: Type of lesson, differentiating between practical instrument lessons and theory lessons.
* **`instrument`**: The musical instrument being played.
* **`gender`**: The gender of the musician.
* **`age`**: The age of the musician.

# Understanding the Performance Model

This section describes the formula we used to understand how different factors relate to a musician's overall performance score. Instead of just looking at one thing, we used a comprehensive model to analyze several predictors at the same time, including a musician's age, gender, amount of practice, and the instrument or lesson type they are focusing on. This helps us get a more complete picture of what influences performance.

This model is a mathematical representation of the trends you see in the plot on the home page.

## Model Specification

The formula we used to predict a musician's performance score looks like this:

$$
\text{Performance Score}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Age}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Gender}_i + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Practice Duration}_i + \beta_4 \cdot \text{Instrument}_i + \epsilon_i
$$

Here's a simple breakdown of what each part of the formula represents:

* **$\text{Performance Score}_i$**: This is the predicted score for a specific musician.
* **$\beta_0$**: This is the starting score for a musician, before considering any other factors.
* **$\beta_1$**: This represents the adjustment to the score based on a musician's age.
* **$\beta_2$**: This represents the adjustment to the score based on a musician's gender.
* **$\beta_3$**: This represents the adjustment to the score for the duration of practice.
* **$\beta_4$**: This represents the adjustment to the score for the specific instrument they play.
* **$\epsilon_i$**: This is a small adjustment for all the random factors that the model doesn't account for.

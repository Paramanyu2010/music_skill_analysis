This project, "Music Performance Analytics," explores how various factors contribute to a musician's proficiency and skill development. All the code and data are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Paramanyu2010/music-performance-analytics).

This project was created as part of [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
